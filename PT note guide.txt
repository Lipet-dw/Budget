A. Evaluation 
**Assessment:** The assessment should be a single, concise paragraph that synthesizes the key findings. It must follow this structure: 
1. Start with the patient's age, gender, and primary diagnosis or complaint. 
2. Summarize the most significant subjective reports (like pain levels or functional limitations). 
3. Summarize the key objective impairments (e.g., limited range of motion, decreased strength, positive special tests, and functional outcome measure scores). 
4. Conclude with a prognostic statement about their potential for rehabilitation. 

**Goals** They must be functional, measurable, and patient-specific based on the evaluation notes. 
**Impairment-level or simple functional Goals:**
- [List 3-4 impairment-level or simple functional goals here. Example: Patient will report a decrease in pain from 7/10 to 3/10 during stair negotiation.] 
- [Goal 2]
 - [Goal 3] 
** activity-level or participation-level Goals:** 
- [List 2-3 activity-level or participation-level goals here. Example: Patient will be able to walk 1 mile on the treadmill without pain to resume their gym routine.] 
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]
Assessment paragraph examples
Neck/Shoulder 
Pt is a [age] Yrs [gender] with diagnosis of R shoulder pain. Pt has been working for heavy duty over 10 years and R shoulder pain got worse for 6 months ago. In evaluation, pt demo decreased R shoulder AROM, impaired R GH muscle strength, decreased T/S joint mobility, kyphosis posture, tenderness on rotator cuff, and limited ADLs. In addition, pt shows positive on impingement test and empty can test. The pt?s QuickDASH is 75%, showing impaired ADLs/IADLs with UE. Pt will benefit from skilled physical therapy service to address above impairments and dysfunction to return to PLOF and work without difficulties.  
Back/lower extremity
The [age] Yrs [gender] patient presents to the clinic with a medical history of [input from note] Their chief complaint of [input from note] has significantly limited their ability to participate in [input from note] activities. The patient's physical limitations, including [input from note] overall weakness, decreased 5xSTS performance, impaired single leg stance time, and decreased ambulation distance, further contribute to their restrictions. The 5xSTS is [input from note] sec which shows impaired functional mobility and increased risk for falling. The pt's 6MWT is [input from note] ft which is lower than age-matched norm and shows decreased functional endurance. The pt's LEFS is ***/80 showing limited participation in ADLs/IADLs.  *** Skilled PT is essential for the pt to improve their ***functional mobility, reduce fall risk, and enhance gait safety?

B. progress or discharge note 
The user will provide the subjective and objective findings from the current visit, and may include information from the initial evaluation for comparison. 
Structure your response in the following specific format, using Markdown for bolding: 
**Assessment:** This section should be a single, concise paragraph. 
1. Start by stating this is a progress/re-assessment/discharge visit for the patient's condition. 
2. Summarize the patient's subjective report of progress, including changes in pain and function. 
3. Compare the current key objective findings (e.g., ROM, strength, outcome measure scores) to the previous findings to demonstrate progress, lack of progress, or that goals have been met. 
4. Conclude with a statement summarizing the overall progress made and based on top note of input to phrase plan, DC for discharge with HEP and PN for continue therapy. 

**Progress Towards Goals:** 
- Review the goals established at the initial evaluation (or previous progress note). 
- For each goal, state whether it has been "Met," "Partially Met," or "Not Met."
 - Provide a brief justification for the status based on the note's data. (e.g., "Goal of 120ø knee flexion: Met, patient achieved 125ø today.") 

Progress note example
The pt achieved ***/*** STGs and ***/*** LTGs. The 6MWT distance increased from *** ft to *** ft showing increased ambulation distance and functional endurance. The 5xSTS decreased from *** seconds to *** seconds indicating improved functional mobility The 10MWT SSV improved from 0.*** m/s to 0.*** m/s and their FV improved from *** m/s to *** m/s showing increased safety with household and community ambulation. Their BBS scored from **/56 to **/56, showing a decreased risk for falling. The pt is still limited by their decreased ambulation endurance, balance deficits, and reduced BLE strength. Continued participation in PT is recommended for the pt to return to their prior level of function.
